"""pack manifest judging criteria -- the derived measure in pipeline_core.pack_manifest.

The manifest is the engine's only door to "what is installed"; --check reports
from it. Three derivations each tripped a real bug, pinned one by one:

  1. pack count = non-underscore pipelines: internal fragments (sub-pipeline
     tails) are not packs, only call-able. The measure must agree with
     scheduler.installed_pipelines or the console list and what can actually
     run will diverge;
  2. agent names come from module-level AGENT_NAME, not the file stem:
     http_request_agent.py registers as http_request, and pipelines write the
     registered name. Comparing file stems invented phantom "missing" for 7
     of 14 modules;
  3. call nodes are not agents: quality_tail is a sub-pipeline reference via
     call: _quality-tail. Not following call targets makes it read as
     "referenced but uninstallable".
